This week Iâ€™m doing my favorite thing again - analyzing languages and discussing specific pronunciation challenges that different speakers have (and of course, how to overcome them!).

In this episode Iâ€™m going to talk about challenges that Hindi or Urdu speakers face when speaking in English. Iâ€™m going to discuss intonation and pronunciation and I promise itâ€™s going to be interesting!

Watch this episode if:

- ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™re a speaker of Hindi or Urdu and youâ€™d like to improve your clarity and confidence
- ðŸ‘‰ You communicate with Hindi or Urdu speakers regularly and youâ€™d like to improve your listening abilities and understand your peers better
- ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™re a teacher and youâ€™d like to help your students with their pronunciation
- ðŸ‘‰ Youâ€™re curious about pronunciation and common challenges

By the way If youâ€™re not a Hindi or Urdu speaker, I have a bunch of other videos for different languages! Each video is accompanied by a downloadable pronunciation guide and audio practice. Here they are:
