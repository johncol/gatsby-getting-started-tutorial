Carl Jung once stated that “What you resist, persists–and will grow in size.” I understand this principle well. If I am resisting a conversation that I need to have with a loved one, it will grow heavier in my mind. If I resist any trauma or emotion, it just gets more deeply embedded. I can also see that the more the Right fights against the Left, the more entrenched each side gets in their position.

But undoubtedly there is a time to stand up and fight back. But how to fight? What are the most effective weapons in an ideological war? The current paradigm ascribes to the old idea of total control. Control the narrative with manipulative emotional appeals and outright propaganda, censor dissenting opinions, slander powerful voices with ad hominem attacks, and create new laws enforced by the biggest guns.

The master’s tools will not dismantle the master’s house. No act of force will truly liberate a people from tyranny. It just replaces the old tyranny with a new tyranny. The way to fight back can’t be any of that. So how do we fight back?

I’m not writing this newsletter as a battle cry. Because I don’t assume that we all believe the same thing. But what I do know is that whatever you are fighting for, there is a way to fight. Your only effective weapon is to use the energy of the world that you are fighting for.

And this is the key differentiator. Instead of fighting against something, which places you at the energy of what you are AGAINST, you have to fight FOR something. Instead of fighting against racism, for example, fight FOR a world where everyone treats each other ‘not based on the color of their skin, but the content of their character.’ And treat people based on the content of their character. Instead of fighting against censorship, fight for a world where people are free to express their opinions. And freely express your opinion. Instead of fighting against the manipulation of pharmaceutical companies, fight for truth and awareness. And celebrate the miraculous healing power of your own body and mind.

Maybe it seems to some of you like this won’t be enough–believing we need new regulations, and more guns on our side. I disagree. This is the ONLY thing that will be enough. It is the only thing that will work.

And we have a lot of allies that are just on the horizon. Because all of the darkness in the world is based in fear and delusion–the belief that we are separate from one another, and undeserving of love. But there are medicines for that sickness. And they represent a revolution.

On today’s podcast I talk with Dr. Dave Rabin about one of these medicine allies that is already legal: Ketamine. It’s the first of the great psychedelic paladins that is coming to our aid. And while ketamine and further medicines like MDMA and Psilocybin are on track to be approved for psychiatric conditions–the side effect of all of them is truth, love, and the liberation from fear. The more challenging the mindscape of society becomes, the more people will be drawn to medical treatment with psychedelics. And then accidentally along the way, they will encounter the numinous. The transcendental. This is why I have hope. If you listen to today’s show, hopefully you will have hope as well.

Love Y’all!
