Did you catch my email about another way to work with me on a more affordable level?

It's called Hadar's Pronunciation Workshop, and I'm offering it for $297 until Thursday night. This mini-course with lifetime access is so jam-packed with info, it should be called a MEGA-course! [Click here for a peek inside.](https://accentsway.activehosted.com/lt.php?s=19a6afd4e482f5147d8ff508006fcff0&i=2807A4720A116A21229)

This program is great if you want varied and extensive practice resources, an organized platform/app, and an effective plan, BUT don‚Äôt need the hands-on practice and guidance, live sessions and everything else New Sound has to offer.

Because you're more like -

It also includes the Practice Toolkit, which is worth the cost of the whole course!

This is what Anastasia had to say about it:
This is a precious asset!Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èI already started working with itü§ì Now I don't need to do much planning, just press "Play": the optimal solution for busy (and lazy) people üòäI like the structure of the lessons! Thank you, Hadarü§ó

In 56 (!!) different audio lessons, I say a sentence, and give you time and space to repeat it. Over time and with short practice sessions, you begin to naturally integrate the sounds and intonation into your speech.

The key to mastering your English is practice and with the Toolkit, it's like having me as your English coach on call!

Hadar‚Äôs Pronunciation Workshop and the Toolkit is available in an easily accessible app so you can practice at your convenience and track your progress.

This course is your secret weapon to mastering your English pronunciation. It'll help you speak confidently and clearly in English, so the next time opportunity knocks, you‚Äôre ready and waiting!

Remember, this offer expires in 3 days!

Don't miss out!

Love,

Hadar
